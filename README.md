# Project Structure

## Architecture & Design

Modular Architecture
- âœ… All Swift code organized in a more Git friendly Swift packages, only leaving a thin app shell using Xcode project
  - **Note**: structuring Package.swift at root level might not be possible on latest Xcode versions.
- [ ] Feature-per-target approach: each feature has its own target: We can go as further as one screen per target.
- [ ] Router pattern for inter-module navigation
    

## Security

- Secure Credential Management
    - âœ… API keys stored in GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
    - ðŸš§ Sensitive tokens stored in iOS Keychain

## Backend Integration

- ðŸš§ Multiple API Integration Examples
    - ðŸš§ REST API implementation (TMDB)
    - ðŸ”´ GraphQL implementation (Rick & Morty API)

## Development Tools & Automation

- âœ… Code Generation
    - ðŸ”´ Sourcery for mock generation
    - ðŸš§ SwiftGen for type-safe assets and localizations (Note: SwiftGen still not supporting Xcode 15 String catalog)

- ðŸš§ CI/CD Pipeline
    - GitHub Workflows:
        - ðŸš§Automated testing on PR
        - ðŸš§ Code coverage checks
        - Auto-deployment to TestFlight
        - Auto-deployment to BrowserStack
        - Scheduled integration testing
        - Automated snapshot testing

## UI/UX

- ðŸš§ UI Development
    - [ ] SwiftUI Previews for all UI components
    - [ ] Demo implementations for all UI targets
    - [ ] Snapshot tests for UI consistency
