# Project Structure

## Architecture & Design

- âœ… Modular Architecture
    - [ ] Thin app shell using Xcode project
    - [ ] Feature-per-target approach
    - [ ] Screen-per-target implementation
    - [ ] Router pattern for inter-module navigation
    - [ ] All Swift code organized in Swift packages for Git efficiency

- âœ… Multiple Architecture Patterns
    - [ ] MVVM implementation examples
    - [ ] Clean Architecture implementation
    - [ ] Comparison of UIKit vs SwiftUI approaches

## Security

- âœ… Secure Credential Management
    - [ ] API keys stored in GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
    - [ ] Sensitive tokens stored in iOS Keychain
    - [ ] No credentials in codebase

## Backend Integration

- ðŸš§ Multiple API Integration Examples
    - [ ] REST API implementation (TMDB)
    - [ ] GraphQL implementation (Rick & Morty API)

## Development Tools & Automation

- âœ… Code Generation
    - [ ] Sourcery for mock generation
    - [ ] SwiftGen for type-safe assets and localizations

- ðŸš§ CI/CD Pipeline
    - [ ] GitHub Workflows:
        - Automated testing on PR
        - Code coverage checks
        - Auto-deployment to TestFlight
        - Auto-deployment to BrowserStack
        - Scheduled integration testing
        - Automated snapshot testing

## UI/UX

- ðŸš§ UI Development
    - [ ] SwiftUI Previews for all UI components
    - [ ] Demo implementations for all UI targets
    - [ ] Snapshot tests for UI consistency

# Getting Started

[TBD: Add setup instructions]

# Architecture Overview

The project demonstrates various architectural approaches:

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Each feature/screen is isolated in its own target
   - Navigation handled via Router pattern
   - Swift packages for better source control

2. **Multiple Architecture Patterns**
   - MVVM examples for [specific feature]
   - Clean Architecture implementation for [specific feature]
   - Comparative implementations in UIKit and SwiftUI

# Backend Integration

The project showcases different backend integration approaches:

1. **REST API (TMDB)**
   - [Description of implementation]

2. **GraphQL (Rick & Morty)**
   - [Description of implementation]

# Development Workflow

## CI/CD Pipeline

Automated workflows include:
- Pull Request validation
- Test coverage reporting
- Automated deployments
- Integration testing
- UI testing

## Code Generation

- **Sourcery**: Automated mock generation for testing
- **SwiftGen**: Type-safe resources management

[TBD: Add contribution guidelines, license information, etc.]
