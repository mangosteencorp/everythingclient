The affordable living conditions and relatively free creative environment attracted independent artists from all over China. They arrived with utopian dreams and a thirst for artistic freedom, surviving and creating in the name of art, and developing a unique way of life. Over time, more flocked to the area, leading to the emergence of related industries and small businesses. Streets, shops, taverns, artist studios, and village residences formed a complex network. Over the course of more than a decade, Xiaopu Village transformed from a handful of artists to China's largest art community, with a population of over ten thousand. The cohabitation and interactions with indigenous peoples, local government, and commercial capital, all contributed to Songzhuang's distinctive artistic ecology and made it a microcosm of China's transitional era.",
