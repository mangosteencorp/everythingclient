# Copilot Learning Notes

## TMDB_TVShowDetail Refactor (July 2025)

**Industry Practices Applied:**
- **No ViewModels Pattern**: Following Apple's WWDC19 Data Flow Through SwiftUI philosophy, eliminated ViewModel layer for simpler view-centric state management
- **Enum-Based State Management**: Used Swift enums (`ViewState.loading/.loaded/.error`) for clear, type-safe state representation 
- **Component Decomposition**: Split monolithic views into focused, single-responsibility components (PosterImageView, TVShowOverviewSection, etc.)
- **Constructor Dependency Injection**: Used traditional DI pattern for services while maintaining clean view architecture
- **Reactive Programming**: Leveraged SwiftUI's `.task(id:)` and `.refreshable` for declarative side effects and data loading

**Apple APIs Used:**
- SwiftUI `@State` for local view state management
- SwiftUI `@EnvironmentObject` for shared dependencies (ThemeManager)
- SwiftUI `.task(id:)` modifier for reactive data loading
- SwiftUI `.refreshable` for pull-to-refresh functionality
- Swift async/await for clean asynchronous programming
- NavigationView with .navigationViewStyle(.stack) for iOS 15+ compatibility
